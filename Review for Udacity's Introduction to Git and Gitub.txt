Review for Udacity's Introduction to Git and Gituhb

This class takes you from 0 to confident in Git. The first lessons consists
of learning git commands. The second, Git repositroies. And, the third 
Git, Github, Forking and Merging. The skill level increases overtime but,
that's okay because they give you everthing you need to succeed. 
At the start of the course I had some idea what git and github were (I thought
of them as the same thing). I knew that the combination was a useful tool for
storing my previous code online. I knew that Github was useful for finding
solutions to problems that you were working on and a good way to see
what classmates were coding. 
By the end, I knew how to use git and github to collaborate. I learned
what and how version control works. This class definitely did a better job
at teaching Git/Github than my professor (Josh Tenenberg). I now feel
confident to work on projects collaboratively and use version control to 
maximize my personal benefit. 
I had a senior in my program the other day ask what version control was 
(while using Git and Github). I cringed inside but, I knew it wasn't his fault,
I let him know about the course to help him make up for our terrible professor.

This course should be required after every intro to cs course.
Some things were not annoying however. 
I had trouble doing the last project which involved forking and 
cloneing a project from Udacity. The project would not checkout on
to my computer because file names was too long in the directories.
I posted to the forums and got an answer the next day on how to fix
this problem. This could have been some sort of targeted marketing (it is 
only my second course and first question post to the forum). Either way,
I am greatful for the speedy response.
