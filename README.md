# How to Use Git and GitHub - ud775 -Reflections
This repo contains reflections from my course "How to Use Git and GitHub" offered by Udacity.

##What this course taught me
I quickly learned that knowing how to effectively use version control is an important skill for any developer.
After completing this course, I gained familiarity with one of the most popular version
control platforms, Git. I learned how to more effectively share code with friends, 
colleagues, and future and current employers all via GitHub.
