# How to Use Git and GitHub - ud775 -Reflections
This repo contains reflections from my course "How to Use Git and GitHub" offered by Udacity.

##What this course taught me
By completing this course, I gained familiarity with one of the most popular version
control platforms, Git. I learned how to more effectively share code with friends, 
colleagues, and future and current employers all via GitHub.

##Why I took this course and Course Summary
Effective use of version control is an important and useful skill for any developer working on long-lived (or even medium-lived) projects, especially if more than one developer is involved. This course, built with input from GitHub, introduced the basics of using version control by focusing on a particular version control system called Git and a collaboration platform called GitHub.

##Why I took this course
Git is used by many tech companies, and a public GitHub profile serves as a great portfolio for any developer. But more than that, I wanted to establis an efficient programming workflow that allows me to:

* Keep track of multiple versions of a file
* Track bugs by reverting to previous working versions of a file
* Seamlessly collaborate with other developers on a project

The use of tools like Git and GitHub is essential for collaborating with other developers in most professional environments.

## Course Final Proect 
I published this repository containing my reflections from the course. Also, I forked a repo, made changes, merged the changes with two updates made in the master repo, then submitted a pull request (to collaborative Create-Your-Own-Adventure story).  

##Course Syllabus
###Lesson 1: Navigating a Commit History

In this lesson, I learned about a few different types of version control systems and discovered what makes Git a great version control system for programmers. I also got practice using Git to view the history of an existing project. I learned to see all the versions that have been saved, checkout a previous version, and compare two different versions.

###Lesson 2: Creating and Modifying a Repository

In this lesson, I learned how to create a repository and save versions of my project. I learned about the staging area, committing my code, branching, and merging, and how I can use these be more efficient and effective.

###Lesson 3: Using GitHub to Collaborate

In this lesson, I got practice using GitHub (remote repositories) to share my changes with others and collaborate on multi-developer projects. I learned how to make and review a pull request on GitHub. Finally, I got practice with all of the skills I learned in the course by collaborating with other Udacity students to write a create-your-own-adventure story.
