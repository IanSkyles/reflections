# How to Use Git and GitHub - ud775 -Reflections
This repo contains reflections from my course "How to Use Git and GitHub" offered by Udacity.

##What this course taught me
By completing this course, I gained familiarity with one of the most popular version
control platforms, Git. I learned how to more effectively share code with friends, 
colleagues, and future and current employers all via GitHub.

##Why I took this course and Course Summary
Effective use of version control is an important and useful skill for any developer working on long-lived (or even medium-lived) projects, especially if more than one developer is involved. This course, built with input from GitHub, introduced the basics of using version control by focusing on a particular version control system called Git and a collaboration platform called GitHub.

##Why I took this course
Git is used by many tech companies, and a public GitHub profile serves as a great portfolio for any developer. But more than that, I wanted to establis an efficient programming workflow that allows me to:

* Keep track of multiple versions of a file
* Track bugs by reverting to previous working versions of a file
* Seamlessly collaborate with other developers on a project

The use of tools like Git and GitHub is essential for collaborating with other developers in most professional environments.

## Course Final Proect 
I published this repository containing my reflections from the course. Also, I forked a repo, made changes, merged the changes with two updates made in the master repo, then submitted a pull request (to collaborative Create-Your-Own-Adventure story).  

##Course Syllabus
###Lesson 1: Navigating a Commit History

In this lesson, you’ll learn about a few different types of version control systems and discover what makes Git a great version control system for programmers. You’ll also get practice using Git to view the history of an existing project. You’ll learn to see all the versions that have been saved, checkout a previous version, and compare two different versions.

###Lesson 2: Creating and Modifying a Repository

In this lesson, you’ll learn how to create a repository and save versions of your project. You’ll learn about the staging area, committing your code, branching, and merging, and how you can use these to make you more efficient and effective.

###Lesson 3: Using GitHub to Collaborate

In this lesson, you’ll get practice using GitHub or other remote repositories to share your changes with others and collaborate on multi-developer projects. You’ll learn how to make and review a pull request on GitHub. Finally, you’ll get practice by collaborating with other Udacity students to write a create-your-own-adventure story.
